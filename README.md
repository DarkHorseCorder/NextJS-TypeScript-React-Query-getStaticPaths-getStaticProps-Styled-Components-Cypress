# Technical Test for Frontend Developer

## Overview

The goal of this test is to evaluate your skills as a frontend developer. You will be building a small Nextjs application that displays a list of quests and sends the user to the quest page on click.

You can find the Figma design to implement [here](https://www.figma.com/file/NsOrfryi2VoVTmQCEM4vt3/Front-end-Application?node-id=0%3A1&t=66RyEXHpyshdytVl-1).

## Tasks

- Clone this repository
- Fetch and display a list of quests using `/api/quests`.
